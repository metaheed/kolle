# Ingest and process document data and download as knowledge graph or flatten data

As a part of this tutorial, we will see how to transfer the XML data to the knowledge graph model using Kolle without writing any single line of code.

#### High level

Json data -> Flatten model -> data contract -> RDF data

Producer: Json data

Consumer: RDF data

### Processing step

1. Importing json data
2. Applying flattening to build a flattened model from a semi-structure source data
3. View data
4. Download as rdf data

### Technical setup

1. Json as input data source
2. Kafka for event streaming to ingest and process data in real-time
3. Kolle for metabase repository and automation
